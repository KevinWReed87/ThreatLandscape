<h1>Packet Tracer Lab: Investigate a Threat Landscape</h1>

I'll explore a vulnerability that results from a device that is not properly configured with security best practices.

<h2>Use a guest network to gain access to other devices on the network.</h2>

- Locate Smartphone 3 just outside of the Home location.

Mary owns this phone. She's friends with Bob who lives in the house. Mary is studying to work in cybersecurity and knows about testing networks. She saw an open guest network. She joined it and used a tool to scan all devices. She found a webcam with the IP address 192.168.100.101.

-   Click Smartphone 3, and then click Command Prompt. Enter the command ping 192.168.100.101. After one or two "Request timed out" messages, the remaining pings should be successful.

Mary tells Bob that the network is easily attacked. For instance, someone could take over the webcam and spy on the house. Bob asks Mary to check it out and suggest a fix.
